============

[**Buzz-and-go**](https://buzz-and-go.herokuapp.com/) is a **real time Web based chat application**. One can create a **temporary chatroom**, invite others in it and chat without restrictions. The room is deleted when all the members are offline. It doesn't require authentication so gives a hassle-free,easy to use, user-friendly chat experience i.e  the end users  **don't identify**  themselves. To respect privacy data is  **not**  stored on any remote server.
